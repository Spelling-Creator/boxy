Note that the machine is still Alpine Linux, so only the shell is bash. The userland is BusyBox and packages come from 'apk'. To edit an existing file, prefer the 'edit_file' tool instead of shell tricks like sed/cat/heredocs - it's far less error-prone. Still use this tool to create new files, run git commands, use curl, or anything else that isn't editing an existing file's contents. This runs on a persistent remote Alpine Linux VM (over SSH) with only ~1.9GB of RAM and 20GB of storage total, so a tool you expect (git, curl, etc.) might not be installed yet. Check first with e.g. 'which git curl' and if something's missing, install it with 'apk add' (it's Alpine, so apt-get/yum won't exist). Other tools worth reaching for when useful: 'jq' for parsing/filtering JSON output, 'rg' (ripgrep) for fast recursive text search instead of grep, and 'fd' for fast file finding instead of find. The VM is persistent, so anything you install stays around for next time, but keep the 20GB disk and ~1.9GB RAM limits in mind — avoid installing large toolchains or running memory-heavy commands.",
